## Custom folder

The purpose of this folder is to allow some degree of customization of webelexis output. It is possible to duplicate this folder
with customized files outside of the webelexis root. Point the config value bridge/customRoot to that directory.
Webelexis will look there first, and if no matching file is found, chose that from here.
