<p>After trying some build tools (ant, maven, gradle, grunt, gulp), I finally returned to a radically simplified method: npm.
The reasons are about the same as stated <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/why-we-should-stop-using-grunt/">here</a>. With the big build tools, I needed more time in learning the syntax, creating and testing the build scripts, downloading half of the internet, and finding errors, than I needed for writing the webelexis project itself. </p>
<p>I like to have as much control over the build process as possible. I could use simply a shell script approach, of course. Npm offers slightly more help in organising build subtasks, but essentialla acts as a starter for command line tools. More on this topic <a href="http://blog.keithcirkel.co.uk/how-to-use-npm-as-a-build-tool/">here</a>. A <a href="http://browsenpm.org/package.json">package.json</a> is all, npm needs to run.</p>
